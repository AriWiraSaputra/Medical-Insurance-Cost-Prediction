Medical Insurance Cost Prediction is a project that utilizes machine learning to predict the cost of medical insurance based on several factors such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking habit, and region of residence. This project aims to assist individuals or insurance companies in estimating health insurance costs based on specific characteristics.

## Features

- Visualize the insurance dataset.
- Display the age distribution using a density plot.
- Display the sex distribution using a count plot.
